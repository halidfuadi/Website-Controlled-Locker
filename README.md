using NODEMCU 8266, i have accomplished on controlling lock and unlock mechanism using website 

by using 3 part of hardware, such as:
- NodeMCU 8266 WiFi
- Servo Motor 180
- Bread Board

the system is connected via wifi and local host in order to access the website, also by using looping the system is able to request the value from the database system at the website to lock and unlock the mechanism by initiating the servo to turn 0 or 180 based on the given value
